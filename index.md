## Iterations

## About the course

This is an online, but mostly live course on the practice and theory of brain
imaging.

See [this 2016 Berkeley
course](https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/) for some idea of
what the course will be like.

We wrote up a similar course in [Frontiers in
Neuroimaging](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00727).

In order to work productively in imaging, you will need to be able to read and
write simple code to manipulate images, move and modify files, and run analysis
steps.  You will need code.

But modern programming languages, such as Python, are not just an additional
skill that you will need for intermediate and advanced work.  They are
— languages — in which you can express and explore the fundamental *ideas* that
lie behind the analysis.   These are ideas in signal processing, image
processing, and, most obviously, in statistics.  This course is not designed in
order for you to *learn to code*, it is designed so that you use *code to
learn*.

You may be able to do your work with code, and explain it, but your results
will be full of error unless you organize your work carefully, and you can
collaborate with others.  We will teach you this organization and collaboration
so you can work more effectively and productively with your mentors and peers.
Along the way, you will find you have all the tools you need to do accurate,
reproducible research.  Collaboration and reproducibility are very close ideas.

Lastly, we will teach you to engage with your tools.  Just as you collaborate with your peers to do your research, so you will learn to collaborate with your peers who are building and maintaining the code you use.  We will teach you to become an owner and contributor to the common tools that we use.   By contributing, you will help your field, and you will learn from others how to use code more effectively and to do a wider range of work.

## The team

Your teachers are themselves researchers in brain imaging, and contributors to brain imaging tools.  Between us, we have many decades of experience in teaching brain imaging, and in brain imaging research.  The team are:

* Matthew Brett
* Chris Markiewicz
* Oscar Estaban
* Zvi Baratz

## Prerequisites

You should know some very basic programming in any language. In particular, we
will expect you to know what variables and [for
loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop) are, and how to call functions.
That said, if you are prepared to catch up as you go, and interact with us,
your teachers, you may be able to get away without any background using code.

We will be teaching in Python, but we are expecting that many of you will never
have used Python before.

You will find the course easier if you have done some brain imaging analysis
before, but that is not a requirement.

## Schedule

This is the preliminary sketch of what we cover in the 16 live sessions.

1. Introduction to Python.  What is an image?
2. The Jupyter Notebook.  Numpy.
3. Images, arrays, and plotting.
4. Arrays in three and four dimensions.
5. Arrays with four dimensions and time series.
6. Python modules and scripts.  The text editor.
7. Version control and collaboration.
8. Outlier detection.  Testing.
9. Correlation and regression. The general linear model.
10. T tests.  Analysis of variance
11. Multiple comparison correction
12. Convolution and the hemodynamic response.
13. Interpolation and slice timing.
14. Optimization and image registration.
15. Affine transforms.  Cross-modality registration.
16. Cross-subject registration.
