## Git walk-through

### Basic configuration

We need to tell git about us before we start. This stuff will go into
the commit information by default.

<!-- $ rm -rf our_work
 -->
```
$ git config --global user.name "Matthew Brett"
$ git config --global user.email "matthew.brett@gmail.com"
```

git often needs to call up a text editor. We will use Atom as our text editor
(see [associating text editors with git](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git)):

```
$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

We also turn on the use of color, which is very helpful in making the
output of git easier to read:

```
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
```

### Getting help

```
$ git
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone             Clone a repository into a new directory
   init              Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add               Add file contents to the index
   mv                Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore           Restore working tree files
   rm                Remove files from the working tree and from the index
   sparse-checkout   Initialize and modify the sparse-checkout

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect            Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff              Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep              Print lines matching a pattern
   log               Show commit logs
   show              Show various types of objects
   status            Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch            List, create, or delete branches
   commit            Record changes to the repository
   merge             Join two or more development histories together
   rebase            Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset             Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch            Switch branches
   tag               Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch             Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull              Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push              Update remote refs along with associated objects

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
See 'git help git' for an overview of the system.
```

Try `git help add` for an example.

### Initializing the repository

We first make a new empty directory that will be version controlled with git.

<!-- $ mkdir our_work
 -->
Create the git repository:

```
$ cd our_work
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Volumes/zorg/mb312/dev_trees/psych-214-fall-2016/working/our_work/.git/
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
```

Show the new `.git` directory:

```
$ ls .git
HEAD
config
description
hooks
info
objects
refs
```

There are only a couple of empty sub-directories in the `.git/objects`
directory:

```
$ ls .git/objects/*
.git/objects/info:

.git/objects/pack:
```

### git add - put stuff into the staging area

Type this file in Atom and save:

Add to the staging area:

```
$ git add our_paper.txt
```

<!-- git rev-parse :our_paper.txt -->
Check we added the file to the staging area:

```
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   our_paper.txt

```

Show yourself there is a new sub-directory and file in `.git/objects`:

```
$ ls .git/objects/*
```

### Looking at real git objects

Now we’re going to read the new object in Python, and find the hash of its
contents.  You don’t need to do this kind of thing to use git.  This is to
practice some Python, and to show you how git stores its files.

To read the new object, you’ll need a few new bits of Python.

Here’s how to read the binary contents of a whole file into memory:

```{python}
# Open a file in Read Binary mode to read bytes
fobj = open('our_paper.txt', 'rb')
# Read contents as bytes
contents = fobj.read()  # Read the whole file
fobj.close()
type(contents)
```

Here’s how to calculate the SHA1 hash value for the file contents:

```{python}
# Import the Python module that calculates hash values
import hashlib
# Generate the SHA1 hash string for these bytes
hashlib.sha1(contents).hexdigest()
```

This is the same value as the terminal command `shasum` calculates on a
file:

```
$ shasum our_paper.txt
cb083f8092a8bfbe55a215e1b45e9f33b9dec86f  our_paper.txt
```

The new file in `.git/objects` is *compressed* using a program called
`zlib`.  To un-compress some bytes that have been compressed with `zlib`,
use the `decompress` function in the Python `zlib` module:

```{python}
import zlib
zlib.decompress
```

<!-- echo "function sha_fname { echo \${1:0:2}/\${1:2}; }; sha_fname " -->
<!-- fname=$({{ sha_fname }} {{ our_paper_1_hash }})
echo ".git/objects/$fname" -->
Now – what is the *decompressed* contents of the new `.git/objects` file?
Do you recognize it?  What is the SHA1 hash of the decompressed contents?  Do
you recognize that?

You should start with something like:

```
>>> fobj = open('.git/objects/d6/05b79accc16319ffe95fdc0a7992e830695c1c', 'rb')
```

where `.git/objects/d6/05b79accc16319ffe95fdc0a7992e830695c1c` is the new file that appeared in your
`.git/objects` directory when you staged `our_paper.txt`.

When you are done, have a look at the solution in: [reading git objects](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/reading_git_objects.html).

# Make a first commit

Remember what will go into this commit:

```
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   our_paper.txt

```

Make the commit:

```
$ git commit
```

<!-- $ git commit -m "First version of the paper"
[master (root-commit) 8d1e37f] First version of the paper
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 our_paper.txt
 -->
Review what you have so far in your history:

```
$ git log
```

Show what branch you are on, with the hash of the current commit:

```
$ git branch -v
```

# Edit again, check and commit

Edit the paper file again to add some text:

Check the difference between what you had before and what you have now:

```
$ git diff
```

Add the changes to the staging area:

```
# What goes here?
```

<!-- $ git add our_paper.txt
 -->
Our customary check:

```
$ git status
```

Make the commit:

```
$ git commit
```

<!-- $ git commit -m "Second version of the paper"
[master cece131] Second version of the paper
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 -->
Look at the project history again:

<!-- $ git log
commit cece1310670982408d91bd645b67ec45ddb9c75f
Author: Matthew Brett <matthew.brett@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 15 14:35:13 2016 +0100

    Second version of the paper

commit 8d1e37fdcefe90487c577435b1fa6ccb70d1ff07
Author: Matthew Brett <matthew.brett@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 15 14:30:13 2016 +0100

    First version of the paper
 -->
Check the parent hashes recorded in each commit.  How?:

```
# Check the parents
```

Check which hash the default branch is pointing to now:

```
$ git branch -v
```

# A new file

Make a new file like this:

Check the status of the file.

Add the file to the staging area.

Make a commit.

<!-- $ git add our_analysis.py
 -->
<!-- $ git commit -m "Add analysis"
[master 73f471c] Add analysis
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 our_analysis.py
 -->
# A prettier log command

```
$ git config --global alias.slog "log --oneline --graph"
```

```
$ git slog
* 73f471c Add analysis
* cece131 Second version of the paper
* 8d1e37f First version of the paper
```

# Thinking about objects again

See if you can guess how many files there are now in `.git/objects`.

What do these objects store?

If you have the hash of an object, you can check the contents with `git
cat-file -p` followed by the first 7 digits of the hash value – e.g.

<!-- echo "function sha_7 { echo \${1:0:7}; }; sha_7 " -->
<!-- {{ sha_7 }} {{ our_paper_1_hash }} -->
```
$ git cat-file -p d605b79
This is the first sentence of the new paper.
```

See if you can find the hash of the object corresponding to the directory
listing for our most recent commit, and display its contents.  Hint: Find the
hash for the current commit message.  Try displaying the contents for the
current commit message.

# Moving files

Try moving a file (renaming) using `git mv`:

```
$ git mv our_analysis.py our_first_analysis.py
```

Check the status.  Do you need to add anything to the staging area?

Make a commit.

Now you have made a commit, check the new directory listing for our latest
commit.  What changed?

<!-- $ git commit -m "Move analysis file"
[master 201f081] Move analysis file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename our_analysis.py => our_first_analysis.py (100%)
 -->
# Making a new branch

Make a new branch with:

```
$ git branch work-from-home
```

Use `git branch -v` to check the hash that this new branch points to.

Have a look at the file `.git/HEAD`.  What is it telling us?

Tell git to start working on the new branch instead of our previous branch:

```
$ git checkout work-from-home
Switched to branch 'work-from-home'
```

Have a look at `git branch -v` again.  What changed?  How about the file
`.git/HEAD`?

<!-- $ echo "" >> our_paper.txt
$ echo "The third sentence starts the crescendo." >> our_paper.txt
 -->
Now see if you can replicate the following changes to `our_paper.txt`:

```
diff --git a/our_paper.txt b/our_paper.txt
index d18df62..75fe792 100644
--- a/our_paper.txt
+++ b/our_paper.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,5 @@
 This is the first sentence of the new paper.
 
 Crucially, this is the second sentence.
+
+The third sentence starts the crescendo.
```

Your job is to make the output from `git diff` look the same as the output
above.

When you’ve finished, add the changes to the staging area and then commit.

<!-- $ git add our_paper.txt
 -->
<!-- $ git commit -m "Move analysis file"
[work-from-home 0adaaf7] Move analysis file
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 -->
Check where you are with `git slog`, and `git branch -v`.

Now go back to your previous branch, called `master`:

```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

Create this data file, add it to the staging area and commit.

<!-- $ git add our_data.csv
 -->
<!-- $ git commit -m "Add data file"
[master 2ff3b13] Add data file
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 our_data.csv
 -->
# Merging

Now we want to merge the work from the `work-from-home` branch.  Put another
way, we want to merge the `work-from-home` branch into our current branch,
`master`. What git command would do this action?  Scan the output of `git
help` for clues, then `git help <command>` when you’ve found the command
you need.

Do the merge.

<!-- $ git merge work-from-home
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 our_paper.txt | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 -->
Check the output of `git branch -v` again.

Have a look at the output of `git slog`.

What do you see with `git log --parents`?

# Conflicts

The merge that you just did should have been simple, with no conflicts.

Conflicts can occur when you have made changes to the same file on two
different branches, and you try and merge them.  If the changes are on or near
the same lines in the file, git will complain and ask you to work out which
changes you want to keep.

Make and checkout a new branch `asking-for-trouble`.

<!-- $ git branch asking-for-trouble
$ git checkout asking-for-trouble
$ echo "" >> our_paper.txt
$ echo "Fourth sentence gets to the point." >> our_paper.txt
$ git add our_paper.txt
$ git commit -m "Advocate the fourth"
[asking-for-trouble 13fcdf7] Advocate the fourth
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
Switched to branch 'asking-for-trouble'
 -->
Edit `our_paper.txt` and add a sentence like “Fourth sentence gets to the
point.”   Add to the staging area and then commit.

Checkout the `master` branch again.

Edit `our_paper.txt` and add a sentence like “Fourth sentence is still
warm-up.”  Add to the staging area and commit.

<!-- $ git checkout master
$ echo "" >> our_paper.txt
$ echo "Fourth sentence is still warm-up." >> our_paper.txt
$ git add our_paper.txt
$ git commit -m "Nay-say the fourth"
[master 57afaba] Nay-say the fourth
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
Switched to branch 'master'
 -->
Now try merging the `asking-for-trouble` branch into our current
(`master`) branch. What do you see?

<!-- $ git merge asking-for-trouble
Auto-merging our_paper.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in our_paper.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
 -->
When the merge failed, git wrote some text into the file where the changes
clash.  `our_paper.txt` might look like this:

```
This is the first sentence of the new paper.

Crucially, this is the second sentence.

The third sentence starts the crescendo.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Fourth sentence is still warm-up.
=======
Fourth sentence gets to the point.
>>>>>>> asking-for-trouble
```

The lines between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` are the changed lines from
the branch we are merging *into* (`master` in our case).  The lines between
`=======` and `>>>>>>> asking-for-trouble` are the changes from the branch
we are merging (`asking-for-trouble` in our case).

Open the `our_paper.txt` file and remove the new marker lines in the text.
Choose how you’d like to combine your two different changes to the file.  When
the file is ready, save it, then add it to the staging area and do a commit.

Check all is well with `git slog`.

<!-- $ cat << EOF > our_paper.txt
$ This is the first sentence of the new paper.
$ 
$ Crucially, this is the second sentence.
$ 
$ The third sentence starts the crescendo.
$ 
$ Fourth sentence is still warm-up, then gets to the point.
$ EOF
$ git add our_paper.txt
$ git commit -m "Resolve conflict"
[master f4a7ae3] Resolve conflict
 -->
