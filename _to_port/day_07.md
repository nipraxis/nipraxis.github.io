# The HRF, modeling and statistical maps

## Teaching

- [tutorial on convolution];
- {doc}`convolution_background`;
- {doc}`make_an_hrf_exercise`;
- {doc}`hrf_correlation_exercise`.
- {doc}`model_one_voxel`;
- {doc}`test_one_voxel`;
- {doc}`multi_multiply`;
- {doc}`multi_model_exercise`;
- {doc}`non_tr_onsets`;
- [Tutorial on correlated regressors];

% stuff we probably won't have time for:
%
% * modeling FMRI signal with multiple regression and the BOLD regressors;
% * investigating assumptions behind the HRF and linear time invariance.
% * smoothing;
% * t contrasts;
% * using multiple regressors
% * allowing for different onsets with the HRF temporal derivative;
% * investigating power and bias for correlated regressors;
% * modeling the baseline;
% * selecting models;

## Homework and reading for next week
