# Slice timing and motion correction

## Project proposals

Presentation of project proposals and feedback.

We discussed modeling the baseline (e.g. fixation) trials, and we looked at
the [tutorial on correlated regressors].

## Teaching

See the [diagnostics analysis code](https://github.com/psych-214-fall-2016/fmri-designs) for an example of code
organization and testing.

- {doc}`otsu_threshold`;
- Correction with the [false discovery rate];
- [slice timing correction];
- {doc}`slice_timing_exercise`;
- how to do slice timing;
- when to use slice timing;
- slice timing artefacts.

## Reading and homework

- [Rotation in 2D]
- [Coordinate systems and affine transforms];
- A tutorial on [mutual information].
