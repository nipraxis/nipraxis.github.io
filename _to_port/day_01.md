# Arrays, images and plotting

## Teaching

We will be using the background from the tutorial pages from the [scipy
lecture notes][scipy lecture notes]:

- The [numpy array object];
- [Array operations].

We'll cover:

- [numpy] arrays;
- plotting with [matplotlib];
- arrays can be displayed as images;
- a 2D array is a 2D image;
- 3D arrays and brain volumes;
- reshaping and slicing arrays;
- histograms;

See:

- {doc}`arrays_and_images`;
- {doc}`reshape_and_3d`.

## Setup

See: [associating text editors with git].

## Exercises

- {doc}`camera_exercise`;
- {doc}`anatomical_exercise`;
- {doc}`arteries_exercise`.

% To cover
% Numpy allows creation of arrays
% An image is an array
% An array can be displayed with matplotlib
% An array can be reshaped
% An array can be transposed
% A 3D image is a 3D array
% A 3D array can be reshaped to 1D and back again
% Histograms.
% Operations on 1D (implicit) - mean, min, max
% Operations over axes (explicit) - mean, min, max
% np.lookfor
% Setting the colormap

## Reading and homework for next week

- Read, learn, inwardly digest the [curious git] tutorial;
- Watch the videos at {doc}`git_videos`.
