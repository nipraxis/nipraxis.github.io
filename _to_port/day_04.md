# Correlation, regression, statistics on brain images

## Project discussion

- mentors;
- teams.

## Activation

- {doc}`voxels_by_time`;
- {doc}`slicing_with_booleans`;
- {doc}`first_activation_exercise`.

## Correlation and projection

- [vector angles];
- [correlation and projection];
- {doc}`pearson_functions` exercise.

(stimuli-exercise)=

## Correlation in practice

- {doc}`voxel_time_courses`;
- {download}`stimuli.py` file;
- {download}`test_stimuli.py` file;
- ```
  pip install pytest
  py.test test_stimuli.py
  ```

Then one of:

- {doc}`voxel_correlation_exercise`;
- {doc}`correlation_2d_exercise`.

## Simple and multiple regression

- [introduction to the General Linear Model];
- simple regression;
- multiple regression with confounds.

## Reading and homework for next week

- Do exercises from last week's lab: {ref}`git-workflow-exercises`;
- Continue work on outlier detection project for Monday next week.
